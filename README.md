# Event Manager

# Project description

This is a small application created using React. It demonstrates knowledge of state, components, forms, CSS.

It is an event manager which allows you to show/hide a list of events. You can add events by providing a name, date and location. You can also delete saved events.

# Future improvements

Currently the unique ID has a chance of being repeated, therefore a better method to create this would be required if I were to work on this app further.
